# Console Minesweeper!
This is just a small build of Minesweeper built in C++23. It's a simple two file project that does exactly as it says, minesweeper in the console!
Project is very light-weight and could be ran anywhere there's a console as long as your compiler supports the C++23 features.

## Build
Can be compiled anywhere, but the Visual Studio files are there for those who prefer that.
Project requires C++23, mainly for `std::print` and `std::println` support

## How to play
Once ran, the game will print a board to the console and prompt the player for a row number, column number, and action
Like normal Minesweeper, you have 2 actions: place a flag or clear a square. `f` to place a flag and `c` to clear a square.
